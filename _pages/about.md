Hi, I am David, a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href='https://dse.in.tum.de/'>Systems Research Group</a> led by <a href='https://dse.in.tum.de/bhatotia/'>Prof. Pramod Bhatotia</a> at the <a href='https://www.tum.de/'>Technical University of Munich</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh under the guidance of <a href='https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/'>Prof. Boris Grot</a>.

My research interests span Computer Architecture and Computer Systems, with a particular focus on CPU microarchitecture, branch prediction, instruction delivery, and the hardware-software interface. During my PhD, I studied the detrimental effects of frequent context switches in modern cloud workloads [[1](assets/pdf/JUKEBOX_ISCA22.pdf),[2](assets/pdf/IGNITE_MICRO23.pdf)]. My most recent work explores a novel branch predictor organization that enables hierarchical branch predictor designs [[3](assets/pdf/LLBP_MICRO24.pdf)].

As Moore's Law slows down and the world's demand for computing power continues to grow, researchers are challenged more than ever to rethink established mechanisms and develop innovative ideas for a sustainable future. In my postdoctoral research, I am eager to address this challenge by expanding my knowledge in the <a href='https://dse.in.tum.de/'>Systems Research Group</a> and exploring new approaches to bring hardware and software closer together.

If you are interested in addressing these challenges together do not hesitate to contact me. I always look for motivated people.

## Student Projects

I am looking for students interested to work on topics on CPU microarchitecture.

An incomplete list of projects:
- Implementation and evaluation of a modern branch target buffer (BTB) hierarchical in gem5.
- Implementing a state-of-the-art BTB prefetcher in gem5.
- Characterization and optimization of modern data center applications in gem5.
- Evaluating the performance of a multi-block ahead branch predictor in gem5.
- ...

If one of the projects sounds interesting please contact me.
