I am a final year PhD student in the <a href='https://ease-lab.github.io/'>Edinburgh Architecture and Systems Lab (EASE)</a> led by <a href='https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bgrot/'>Prof. Boris Grot</a> at the University of Edinburgh. My research interests span Computer Architecture and Computer Systems. In particular, I'm interested in CPU microarchitecture and the hardware and software interface.

In my last work, I studied the detrimental effects of frequent context switches in modern cloud workloads.

Currently, I am investigating how the ever-increasing instruction working sets of modern server applications stress the CPU microarchitecture.
